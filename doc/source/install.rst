Data is not information,
Information is not knowledge,
Knowledge is not understanding,
Understanding is not wisdom.

There is an immense amount of knowledge available out there,
accessible to our sense by talking to people, reading books,
walking around in beautiful places, surfing on the internet,
watching movies, etc. Wonderful.

But how do we understand all this knowledge? 
Institutions of power have designed ways to indoctrinate us with some of it --
a very partial selection : this is what they call *education*.
These people think we ought to be educated,
and for this they have deprived us of our freedom, they have beaten us, and lied to us many times.

What we want to do, more modestly,
is to teach and to learn freely, 
to spread knowledge more equally
